New Claude Code releases ship fast. Sometimes multiple times per day. Occasionally an update introduces regressions, breaks workflows, or changes behavior you depend on. When that happens, roll back.

Here's how to downgrade both native and NPM installations.

## Why Downgrade?

Claude Code's rapid release cadence means any given update might:

- Introduce bugs or regressions in tool execution
- Change agent behavior or system prompts in ways that break your workflow
- Alter hook behavior or permission handling
- Degrade performance on specific tasks

There's no built-in rollback. Handle it yourself.

## Method 1: Native Installation (Binary)

Native installs are the standalone binaries distributed through `code.claude.com`. To grab a previous version, use the community-maintained **Claude Code Version Archive**:

**[https://alonw0.github.io/cc-versions/site/](https://alonw0.github.io/cc-versions/site/)**

This site is backed by a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alonw0/cc-versions) that automatically monitors Claude Code's official distribution endpoint every hour. When a new version is detected, it downloads all platform installers, verifies them against official SHA-256 checksums, and publishes them as GitHub Releases. The archive currently goes back to v2.0.58.

### Supported Platforms

Every archived version includes binaries for seven platform variants:

| OS | Architecture |
|------|-------------|
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) |
| macOS | x64 (Intel) |
| Linux | ARM64 (glibc) |
| Linux | x64 (glibc) |
| Linux | ARM64 (musl) |
| Linux | x64 (musl) |
| Windows | x64 |

### How to Install a Previous Native Version

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/alonw0/cc-versions/releases)
2. Find the version you want (e.g., v2.1.23)
3. Download the binary for your platform
4. Make it executable and run the installer:

```bash
chmod +x claude-2.1.23-linux-x64
./claude-2.1.23-linux-x64 install
```

The binary replaces your current native installation.

## Method 2: NPM Installation

If you installed via NPM, uninstall the current version and install the specific version you want:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.23
```

Replace `2.1.23` with whatever version you're targeting. NPM handles the rest.

## Preventing Auto-Updates

Critical step most people miss: Claude Code has a built-in auto-updater that silently upgrades you back to the latest version on launch. Disable it **before** launching the downgraded version.

Add or edit your settings file at `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

If the file already exists with other settings, merge the `env` block into your existing configuration. For example, if you already have hooks configured:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  },
  "hooks": {
    ...
  }
}
```

The `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` environment variable gets injected into Claude Code's process at launch. Set to `"1"`, the auto-updater won't run.

**Do this before launching the downgraded version.** Launch first, and the updater may fire before you can disable it.

## Release Channels: Avoid This Next Time

If you're downgrading because a recent update broke something, consider switching to the **stable** release channel. It delivers releases about a week old and automatically skips versions with known regressions.

Configure via `/config` in Claude Code, or edit `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
}
```

Two options:
- **`latest`** (default): New features immediately. Higher risk of bugs.
- **`stable`**: ~1 week delay. Problematic versions filtered out.

Run `/doctor` to check your current channel and see available versions on both.

## Quick Reference

**Downgrade native install:**
1. Download binary from [cc-versions releases](https://github.com/alonw0/cc-versions/releases)
2. `chmod +x claude-VERSION-PLATFORM && ./claude-VERSION-PLATFORM install`
3. Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Downgrade NPM install:**
1. `npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@VERSION`
3. Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Upgrade back to latest:**
1. Remove `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` from settings
2. Launch Claude Code normally (it will auto-update), or reinstall via your preferred method
